#### About Project

Our project is to create a fully end-to-end encrypted, Java-based chat application. It will have a Client GUI which will allow you to input the server information, as well as your personal RSA public and private keys, which will reduce complexity of having to deal with certificates.

#### Installation

Installation requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.7. Compile and run the .java file (Server, or ClientGUI) to start Anti-NSA Chat.

#### Server Usage

To start the Anti-NSA Chat server, compile and run Server.java. Keep in mind only one server instance can be running on a single port on the same machine at a time.

#### Client Usage

To use the client, compile and run the Client*.java files. Enter the server IP and port number and a display name to login, as well as the username of who you want to chat with. Add your RSA key information, and start typing encrypted messages to send!
